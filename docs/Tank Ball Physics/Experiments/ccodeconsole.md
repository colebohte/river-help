## How to use

The new console takes commands from two databases: `ConsoleAPI` and `TBPinternalConsole`.

The interpreter **always** puts priority on the `ConsoleAPI` database before running internally stored commands.

> ⚠️ `ConsoleAPI` commands can be created by 3rd-party developers, so be cautious when running commands imported from mods.
